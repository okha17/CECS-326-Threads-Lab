# CECS-326-Threads-Lab
Assignment Description.Read the documentation forpthread_cancel by typing’man pthread_cancel’(without the quotes) on the Linux command line. Using this information and the model provided below, write a program where the initial (main) thread creates a second thread. The main thread should read inputfrom the keyboard, waiting until the user presses the Enter key. At that point, it should kill off the second thread and print out a message reporting that it has done so. Meanwhile, the second thread should be in an infinite loop, each time around sleeping 3 seconds and then printing out a message. Once the enter key has been pressed, the main thread should wait for 5 seconds to demonstrate that the second thread has been successfully killed and then exit.This program should be coded in C, using the gcc C compiler on POSIX (i.e.  Linux or Mac OS) systems. Answer the following questions in a long-form comment at the top of your code: 
1. Explain what pthread is doing in this program. Be specific.
2. Explain why the sleeping thread can print its periodic messages while the main thread is waiting forkeyboard input.
